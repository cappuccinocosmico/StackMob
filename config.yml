# StackMob 5.0 Configuration file - by antiPerson and contributors.

# Most options can be customised for specific entity types, for details about this, see the end of this file.
# Asterisk meaning:
# (*) This option cannot be overridden in the 'custom' section at the end of this file.
# (**) The following option requires the use of Paper (https://papermc.io) because the API needed is not in Spigot.
